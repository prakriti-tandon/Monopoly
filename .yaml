  Our project is a Cornell-themed Monopoly game that can be played in the 
  terminal. At the moment the game supports two players and has functionality 
  to support buying properties and paying rent to property owners. Players use
  a simple text interface in the terminal that shows them what spot they land 
  on after rolling the dice and enables them to choose whether to buy a 
  property if it is not owned. The game ends when one player runs out of money!

  You can launch the game from terminal by navigating to the source folder and
  running "make play".
